      "story": "Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \n\n\"What are you doing, Cotton?!\" \n\n\"I only wanted to be more like you\". \n\nCotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said \"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \n\n\"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\" \n\nThen Cotton thought, \"I change my mind. I like being special\".",

      "story": "Once there was a beautiful fish named Asta. Asta lived in the ocean. There were lots of other fish in the ocean where Asta lived. They played all day long. \n\nOne day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. \"What is it?\" said Asta's friend Sharkie. \"It looks like a bird's belly,\" said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it. \n\nThe bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. \"What does it say?\" they asked. \n\nAsta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, \"This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her.\" And that is what they did.",

      "story": "My doorbell rings. On the step, I find the elderly Chinese lady, small and slight, holding the hand of a little boy. In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag. \n\nI know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October. \n\nHer daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients. \n\nI know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice. \n\nCommunication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes. \n\n\"Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time,\" I insisted. \"I can hardly do dishes in return.\" \n\n\"Oh, no, Lucy.\" Nicole said. \"Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it.\" \n\nThe doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me. \n\nI am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness. \n\n\"Thank you\" is, of course, the first one. Somehow, it seems inadequate.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as \"Law & Order,\" \"Crime Story,\" and \"Miami Vice,\" has died. He was 69. \n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,\" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. \"Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues.\" \n\nFarina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, \"Thief.\" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as \"Miami Vice\" (in which Farina played a mobster) and \"Crime Story\" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). \n\nFarina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including \"Midnight Run\" (1988), \"Get Shorty\" (1995), \"The Mod Squad\" (1999) and \"Snatch\" (2000). \n\nIn 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running \"Law & Order\" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff \"Trial by Jury.\" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. \n\nFarina was on \"Law & Order\" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show. ",

      "story": "Kendra and Quinton travel to and from school every day. Kendra lives further from the bus stop than Quinton does, stops every morning at Quinton's house to join him to walk to the bus stop. Every afternoon, after school, when walking home from the bus stop they go in for cookies and milk that Quinton's mother has ready and waiting for them. Quinton can't eat cheese or cake so they had the same snack every day. They both work together on their homework and when they are done they play together. Kendra always makes sure to leave in time to get home for dinner. She doesn't want to miss story time which was right before bedtime. \n\nOne morning Kendra walked up to Quinton's house, she thought something might be wrong because normally Quinton was waiting outside for her and on this morning he was not to be found. Kendra went up to the door and knocked. She waited and waited and yet no one answered. She saw that Quinton's mother's car wasn't in their driveway which was weird. She waited for a few bit looking up and down the block and getting worried when Quinton was nowhere to be found. \n\nKendra didn't want to miss the bus to school and hurried off to make it in time. The bus driver saw that she was upset and that Quinton was not with her that morning. She told him what happened and he said that he was sure that everything would be okay. \n\nKendra got to school, ran to her teacher and told him what happened that morning. The teacher smiled and told her not to worry, Quinton's mother had called and he was going to the dentist and would be at school after lunch and that she would see him at the bus stop like normal tomorrow.",

      "story": "Staten Island is one of the five boroughs of New York City in the U.S. state of New York. In the southwest of the city, Staten Island is the southernmost part of both the city and state of New York, with Conference House Park at the southern tip of the island and the state. The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2016 Census-estimated population of 476,015, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at . Staten Island is the only borough of New York with a non-Hispanic White majority. The borough is coextensive with Richmond County, and until 1975 was the Borough of Richmond. Its flag was later changed to reflect this. Staten Island has been sometimes called \"the forgotten borough\" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government. \n\nThe North Shore\u2014especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton\u2014is the most urban part of the island; it contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul's Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character. The West Shore is the least populated and most industrial part of the island.",

      "story": "Thunder was coming when Reginald Eppes woke up at five in the morning. He checked the weather forecast. A violent storm was coming ,but it sounded like his small town wouldn't be hit too hard. But Eppes, a firefighter, had clearly known the power of these huge storms from experiences. \"Do you know where the flashlights are?\" he asked his wife. Danielle. Just then, thunder was all-around them. The moment he turned the flashlight on. The house lights went off. A second later, the kitchen windows were broken. Eppes and Danielle ran to their boys who were still sleeping in their bedroom. \n\n\"Get up, get up, R.J.! \" Eppes shouted, waving his flashlight. The sleepy boy moved to the edge of the bed. Eppes held out his arms and ordered his son to jump. He was too late. The roof was torn down. R.J. was buried ,under the pieces. \n\n\"I've lost him,\" Eppes thought. Quickly, he hurried to Joel to shield him. Glass, wood, and plaster ( ) hit them. Then something huge, heavy-maybe the washing machine-knocked into him. He hurt his arms, but he still held the flashlight in one hand. \n\nAfter a long period, the wind began to die down. Eppes found himself standing in the ruins of his home. Darkness lay all about him. Then he thought he saw a shape moving straight toward him. It was R.J., guided home by the light of his father's flashlight. \n\nAt the hospital later, R.J. described what had happened to him. \"I rushed out when the wall started moving I was scared. My mom and dad were gone. Pieces of glass hit my back, and something hit my neck really hard. \" \n\nR.J. had been raised up into the air by the wind and dropped back to the ground. Amazingly, R.J. was not hurt badly. Of all his family, Eppes was hurt most seriously.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman in Aruba, an agent said. \n\nThe search is occurring in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is currently being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. \n\nAgents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. \n\nSupervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. \n\nAruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. \n\nGiordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. \n\nGiordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. \n\nThe area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. \n\nAlthough prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment. ",

      "story": "Which country grows the most tea? The answer is India. It grows three times as much as China. Which country drinks the most tea? It's neither China nor Japan. It's Great Britain. In the wild, tea plants may be 30 feet tall. But a plant grown for market is pruned. Pruning keeps the plant only three or four feet tall. This is an easy height for tea picking. Only the two top leaves and bud of each new shoot are picked. So to make money, tea plantations must be huge. In general, there are two kinds of tea. Black tea and green tea. Black tea is fermented. In the process, the tea loses nearly all of its healthy qualities. Green tea is steamed right after the leaves are picked. Green tea _ its healthy qualities. For example, it may prevent heart disease. How did we get tea bag? The answer: by accident. Tea merchants used to send samples in tin boxes. This was costly. One merchant thought of a cheaper way. He sent samples in small silk bags. Customers would cut open the bag. They would brew the leaves as usual. One customer put the bag into a pot. Then he just poured hot water over it. And the tea bag was born. Shen Nong was the first to drink tea. (Shen was a Chinese emperor.) This was about 2737 B.C. Shen had bad digestion. So he drank several cups of hot water daily. One day something happened. Leaves from a wild tea tree fell into the hot water pot. The next cup was poured. The water was now colored. Shen sipped it. He liked it. He drank it all. Shen was proud of his new drink. He served it to his guests. Word spread. People thought this way. Tea is good enough for the Emperor. So it must be good enough for the people. Tea became the drink of China.",

      "story": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The German news outlet Der Spiegel has published photographs of what appear to be two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan posing over the bodies of dead Afghans -- images which threaten to further complicate the American military effort there. \n\nTwo images show the soldiers kneeling by a bloody body sprawled over a patch of sand and grass. A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. \n\nDer Spiegel identifies the soldiers as Spc. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes, who are both facing charges relating to the wrongful deaths of Afghan civilians. \n\nSpecifically, Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties, and smoking hashish. \n\nHe is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. \n\nMorlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. \n\nU.S. military rules also prohibit \"taking or retaining individual souvenirs or trophies,\" which the photographs may be construed as. \n\nThe trial for the two soldiers is being conducted at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Morlock's court martial is slated to begin Wednesday, while the start date for Holmes' court martial has not been publicly announced. ",

You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation.\" ",

      "story": "OCLC, currently incorporated as OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Incorporated, is an American nonprofit cooperative organization \"dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world's information and reducing information costs\". It was founded in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center. OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog (OPAC) in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries have to pay for its services (around $200\u00a0million annually ). \n\nOCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of Ohio university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for Ohio libraries. The group first met on July 5, 1967 on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization. The group hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, to design the shared cataloging system. Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management. The goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world's information to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first occurrence of online cataloging by any library worldwide.",

      "story": "Tommy was a little boy who lived by a big lake by the woods. One day he saw two little mice looking at the water. They seemed very sad. \n\n\"What is wrong?\" Tommy asked. \n\nMary, one of the little mice, stood. \"My brother and I love to see new things. We want to see what is on the other side of the lake. But we do not know how to build a boat to get there.\" \n\nTommy smiled. \"I have plenty of toy boats,\" he said. \"They are your size!\" \n\n\"Oh, thank you!\" said Steve, the other little mouse. \"We would be very glad if we could borrow it!\" \n\nTommy went to his house and returned with a small toy boat. The boat had a big sail to make the boat go. Mary and Steve climbed on and Tommy put the boat into the water. \n\nThe boat sailed away across the water! Mary and Steve laughed with joy and had great fun riding the toy boat. \n\nSoon, they reached the other side of the lake. Many people were having fun swimming and splashing in the water. Steve and Mary loved seeing all the new things and people. \n\nA man threw a ball into the water. It landed by the toy boat. The man's big dog came splashing into the water to fetch it. The big waves splashed the little boat every which way! Mary and Steve got very wet. \n\nMary and Steve went back home after that. They told Tommy of what they saw, and they all laughed at the big dog's wave. Tomorrow the mice would see even more of the lake on Tommy's toy boat!",

      "story": "A German taxi-driver, Franz Bussman, recently found his brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years ago. \n\nWhile on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman said that the workman was closely like her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz laughed at the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busman knew this story quite well, she thought there was a chance in a million that she might be right. \n\nA few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman. And he really was Franz's long-lost brother. \n\nWhen the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. \n\nAfter having been wondered towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit . The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his home, but the house had been bombed up. Guessing that his family had all been killed during an air-raid , Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.",

      "story": "CHAPTER XXII \n\nNorthward, along the leeward coast of Malaita, the _Ariel_ worked her leisurely way, threading the colour-riotous lagoon that lay between the shore-reefs and outer-reefs, daring passages so narrow and coral-patched that Captain Winters averred each day added a thousand grey hairs to his head, and dropping anchor off every walled inlet of the outer reef and every mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal life. For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry. So long as the way was interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere. \n\nDuring this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an entire series of names for himself. This was because of an aversion on Harley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing. \n\n\"A name he must have had,\" he argued to Villa. \"Haggin must have named him before he sailed on the _Arangi_. Therefore, nameless he must be until we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name.\" \n\n\"What's in a name?\" Villa had begun to tease. \n\n\"Everything,\" her husband retorted. \"Think of yourself, shipwrecked, called by your rescuers 'Mrs. Riggs,' or 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' or just plain 'Topsy.' And think of me being called 'Benedict Arnold,' or ' Judas,' or . . . or . . . 'Haman.' No, keep him nameless, until we find out his original name.\" \n\n\"Must call him something,\" she objected. \"Can't think of him without thinking something.\" \n\n\"Then call him many names, but never the same name twice. Call him 'Dog' to-day, and 'Mister Dog' to-morrow, and the next day something else.\" ",

      "story": "Brownie and Spotty were neighbor dogs who met every day to play together. These two loved each other and played together so often that they had worn a path through the grass of the field between their respective houses. One evening, Brownie's family noticed that Brownie hadn't returned home. They went looking for him with no success and by the next week he was still missing. Curiously, Spotty showed up at Brownie's house alone. Barking, whining and generally pestering Brownie's human family. Busy with their own lives, they just ignored the nervous little neighbor dog. Continuously,Ted, Brownie's owner, was disturbed by the angry, determined little dog. Spotty followed Ted about, barking insistently, then rushing toward a nearby empty lot and back, as if to say, \"Follow me! It's urgent!\" Eventually, Ted followed Spotty to a deserted spot half a mile from the house. There Ted found his beloved Brownie alive, one of his hind legs crushed in a steel leghold trap. Horrified, Ted now wished he'd taken Spotty's earlier appeals seriously. Then Ted noticed something quite remarkable. Spotty had done more than simply led Brownie's human owner to his trapped friend. In a circle around the injured dog, Ted found an array of dog food and table scraps which were later identified as the remains of every meal Spotty had been fed that week! Spotty had been visiting Brownie regularly, in the hope of keeping his friend alive by sacrificing his own comfort. Spotty had evidently stayed with Brownie to protect him from hunger and other dangers, and keep his spirits up. Brownie's leg was treated by a veterinarian and he recovered. For many years thereafter, the two families watched the faithful friends chasing each other down that well worn path between their houses.",

Upon entering the woods the girl and her dog found that the woods were dark and cold. The girl was a little scared and was thinking of turning back, but yet they went on. The girl's dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog. The bear looked up at the girl and it was almost as if he was smiling at her. He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods. To this day the girl does not know why the bear was so friendly and to this day she has never told anyone about the meeting with the bear in the woods.",

      "story": "HOUSTON (AP) --- A 10-year-old boy fatally shot his father Friday, striking him several times as he sat in the front seat of a SUV to pick up the boy from his mother's home for a weekend visit. \n\nThe incident happened about 3pm on a cul-desac in the 1700 block of Cedar Cove Court, said Sgt. Williams of the Harris County Sheriff's Department. \n\nAn investigation found that Rick James Lohstroh, 41, was shot by his son, who was sitting in the back seat of the man's Toyota 4-Runner, said Sgt. Williams. The shooting took place outside the home of Lohstroh's ex-wife, where the boy lives with his mother and a 7-year-old brother. \n\n\"We're not certain of anything until we finish our investigation,\" Williams said. \"The information we have at this time is that the 10-year-old did fire the weapon.\" \n\nThe mother and the 7-year-old were inside the house when the shooting occurred, said Williams. \n\nWilliams said the gun belonged to the boy's mother. After firing shots through the back seat, the boy exited the back of the vehicle and continued to fire at the car. \n\nThe man died on the way to Memorial Herman Hospital. \n\nLohstroh was a doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. \n\nThe man and woman shared custody of the children. \n\nWilliams said the mother and the boy were still in the home talking to investigators Friday night. \n\nNeighbors described the family as being quiet and keeping to themselves. \n\nJustin Gray, 17, was walking in the neighborhood when he heard gunshots. \"We've had a suicide in this neighborhood once, but never anything like this,\" Gray said.",

      "story": "CHAPTER FIFTY FIVE. \n\nWAITING. \n\nThe lengthening sunny days went on without bringing either what Romola most desired or what she most dreaded. They brought no sign from Baldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the Government, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola. \n\nBoth these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. \n\nFar on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to witness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate that sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It was in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to witness there. ",

      "story": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Natasha Richardson, a film star, Tony-winning stage actress and member of the famed Redgrave acting family, died Wednesday after suffering injuries in a ski accident, according to a family statement. She was 45. \n\nNatasha Richardson fell on a beginners' slope in Canada. \n\nRichardson, wife of actor Liam Neeson, was injured Monday in a fall on a ski slope at a Quebec resort about 80 miles northwest of Montreal. \n\nRichardson's family released a statement saying, \"Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time.\" \n\nAccording to a statement from Mont Tremblant Ski Resort, Richardson fell during a lesson on a beginners' trail. Watch a report on Richardson's life \u00bb \n\n\"She did not show any visible sign of injury, but the ski patrol followed strict procedures and brought her back to the bottom of the slope and insisted she should see a doctor,\" the statement said. \n\nRichardson, accompanied by her instructor, returned to her hotel, but about an hour after the fall was \"not feeling good,\" the statement said. An ambulance was called, and Richardson was taken to a local hospital before being transferred to Hopital du Sacre-Coeur in Montreal. From there she was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \n\nFriends and colleagues were saddened by her death. \n\n\"Natasha was brilliant, beautiful, funny, talented beyond measure, as emotionally raw as she was razor sharp,\" said Jodie Foster, who worked with Richardson in \"Nell,\" in a statement. \"Tasha loved fiercely and that love continues in all of us who knew her. May Liam, her beautiful boys and her loving family hold her close as they move through this tragic moment.\" ",

      "story": "Peter was a very sad puppy. He had been inside of the pet store for a very long time. In fact, he had been there for three months! Peter had seen many other puppies find a person; he began to wonder why he could not get one. He thought that maybe his fur was not pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough. He tried and tried to please every person who came to the store, but they all picked smaller puppies. However, one day all of this changed. Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy. She wanted a puppy she could snuggle with. It so happened that Peter was very sad and tired that day. Sammie came to hold him. Peter wanted to show off his bark, but he was too tired. He fell right to sleep. Sammie loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms. Sammie took Peter home that day, and they made lots of fun memories.",

The movie is about a poor man Ti, his son Dicky and their alien dog CJ7. Dicky, a 10-year-old boy, lives a poor life with his father Ti, a worker. One day,his father finds a ball in the trash and he gives it to Dicky. The ball becomes a cute alien dog. It's a small dog with big eyes and green hair. It can talk and do magic . Soon the dog comes to love Ti and his son. It goes to school with Dicky. It makes him laugh, but it makes trouble, too. When Ti falls off a building and dies, CJ7 saves his life. Because the dog loses all its power , it becomes a doll. But Dicky still wears the dog around his neck. He hopes that CJ7 will come back to life one day.",

      "story": "(CNN) -- For Heather Neroy, it used to be a tedious process: Whenever she came across an interesting arts-and-crafts project or recipe on the Internet, she would save it for later by copying the link, pasting it into an e-mail and sending it to herself. \n\nAfter that Neroy, a stay-at-home mom from Southern California, would file the e-mail in a folder for future reference. It wasn't exactly the most efficient system. \n\nThen last year, during one of her browsing sessions, she read a blog post that gushed about a new website called Pinterest. The virtual pinboard, where users can pin and organize images onto individual \"boards,\" didn't pique Neroy's interest at first, but she quickly changed her mind. \n\n\"Someone described it as an online filing system, and I thought, 'That's exactly what I need,' \" she said. \n\nSoon Neroy was pinning away and, like many Pinterest users, got quickly hooked. She first started with a Halloween board where she pinned costume ideas. Next, Neroy created a shared color board for redecorating her daughter's bedroom that she and her husband could add to. \n\nPinterest also allows other users to follow each other's boards and \"re-pin\" another person's images. In no time Neroy was sharing other people's pins and following users with similar tastes. \n\n\"It's been really neat to see what other moms are pinning,\" she said. \"Some days you run out of ideas and you don't know what to do to fill the time before bedtime. I thought it was going to be just me organizing, but it's really a community sharing all these different ideas that I didn't even know existed.\" ",

A traitor had just come in and told them where Bruce had slept the night before. Reluctantly Archie unfastened the chain from the pole, and holding the end in his hand went round with Hector to the front of the pavilion. He was resolved that if under the dog's guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited. He sniffed here and there, eagerly hunted up and down the cottage, then made a circuit round it, and at last, with a loud deep bay he started off with his nose to the ground, pulling so hard at the chain that Archie had difficulty in keeping up with him. Pembroke and his knights rode a little behind, followed by their men-at-arms. \n\n\"I pray you, Sir Earl,\" Archie said, \"keep not too close to my traces, for the sound of the horse's hoofs and the jingling of the equipments make him all the more impatient to get forward, and even now it taxes all my strength to hold him in.\" ",

      "story": "Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. \n\nLugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. \n\nThe president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. \n\nBrig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. \n\nThe announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. \n\nCibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. \n\nOther changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. \n\nParaguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. \n\nThe military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. \n\nIn April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature. ",

Development in this region is restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Other large settlements include the county town of Aylesbury, Marlow in the south near the Thames and Princes Risborough in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of Buckingham and near Olney in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by Buckinghamshire County Council as a non-metropolitan county, and four district councils. In national elections, Buckinghamshire is considered a reliable supporter of the Conservative Party.",

There could be no hurry, for Nevers was twelve miles away; and it would be four hours, at least, before a party could arrive. \n\nThe landlady herself brought in the next course. After placing the dish upon the table, she stood looking earnestly at him for a minute, and then said: \n\n\"You spoke of stopping here tonight, sir. The accommodation is very poor and, if you will take my advice, you will ride farther. There have been some men along here this afternoon, inquiring for a party like yours; and offering a reward to any who would carry the news to them, should you pass through. Methinks their intentions were not friendly.\" \n\n\"I thank you very much for your counsel,\" Philip said, \"and will take it. I know that there are some who would gladly hinder me, in my journey; and if there is, as you say, a risk of their coming here for me, it were as well that I rode farther, although I would gladly have given my horses a night's rest. I thank you warmly for having warned me.\" \n\n\"Do not let my husband know that I have spoken to you,\" she said. \"He is an honest man, but timid; and in these days 'tis safest not to meddle with what does not concern one.\" \n\nPhilip waited for two hours, and then told Pierre to saddle the horses, and tell the landlord that he wished to speak to him.

      "story": "Wiltshire ( or ) is a county in South West England with an area of . It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire. The county town was originally Wilton, after which the county is named, but Wiltshire Council is now based in the county town of Trowbridge. \n\nWiltshire is characterised by its high downland and wide valleys. Salisbury Plain is noted for being the location of the Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks, and as a training area for the British Army. The city of Salisbury is notable for its mediaeval cathedral. Important country houses open to the public include Longleat, near Warminster, and the National Trust's Stourhead, near Mere. \n\nThe county, in the 9th century written as \"Wiltunscir\", later \"Wiltonshire\", is named after the former county town of Wilton. \n\nWiltshire is notable for its pre-Roman archaeology. The Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age people that occupied southern Britain built settlements on the hills and downland that cover Wiltshire. Stonehenge and Avebury are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK. \n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries Wiltshire was at the western edge of Saxon Britain, as Cranborne Chase and the Somerset Levels prevented the advance to the west. The Battle of Bedwyn was fought in 675 between Escuin, a West Saxon nobleman who had seized the throne of Queen Saxburga, and King Wulfhere of Mercia. In 878 the Danes invaded the county. Following the Norman Conquest, large areas of the country came into the possession of the crown and the church.",

The night she met her noodle friend was spaghetti night. Marsha's favorite dinner was spaghetti, which happened to be every Tuesday night. On one Tuesday, a piece of spaghetti fell on the kitchen floor. To Marsha, it looked like a stick man so she kept him. She named her new noodle friend Joey and took him everywhere she went. Sometimes Joey gets a little dried out so Marsha's mom told her to soak him in water every few days. There were a couple times that the family dog, Mika, has tried to take Joey from Marsha and eat him! So from now on, Marsha takes extra special care to make sure Joey is safe and sound at all times. During the day she keeps him in a plastic bag in her pocket. At night, she puts him under her pillow. She loves Joey and wants to always be friends with him.",

      "story": "CHAPTER XVII: MACHINATIONS \n\n\"Baby born to woe.\" \n\nF. T. PALGRAVE. \n\nWhen Anne Woodford began to wake from the constant thought of the grief and horror she had left at Portchester, and to feel more alive to her surroundings and less as if they were a kind of dream, in which she only mechanically took her part, one thing impressed itself on her gradually, and that was disappointment. If the previous shock had not blunted all her hopes and aspirations, perhaps she would have felt it sooner and more keenly; but she could not help realising that she had put herself into an inferior position whence there did not seem to be the promotion she had once anticipated. Her companion rockers were of an inferior grade to herself. Jane Humphreys was a harmless but silly girl, not much wiser, though less spoilt, than poor little Madam, and full of Cockney vulgarities. Education was unfashionable just then, and though Hester Bridgeman was bettor born and bred, being the daughter of an attorney in the city, she was not much better instructed, and had no pursuits except that of her own advantage. Pauline Dunord was by far the best of the three, but she seemed to live a life apart, taking very little interest in her companions or anything around her except her devotions and the bringing them over to her Church. The nursery was quite a separate establishment; there was no mingling with the guests of royalty, who were only seen in excited peeps from the window, or when solemnly introduced to the presence chamber to pay their respects to the Prince. As to books, the only secular one that Anne saw while at Whitehall was an odd volume of Parthenissa. The late King's summary of the Roman controversy was to be had in plenty, and nothing was more evident than that the only road to favour or promotion was in being thereby convinced. ",

In one hand he held the poster Tom had fastened on his back, and he was shaking his other fist wrathfully. \n\n\"Tom Rover, you've--er--insulted me!\" he gasped as he came up. \"You've humiliated me before the whole class! I'll--I'll----\" The dudish student was so full of wrath he could not speak. \n\n\"Take a cough drop and clear your throat Billy,\" suggested Tom, coolly. \"Don't get so excited, you might drop dead from heart disease.\" \n\n\"How dare you put that--er--that advertisement of Gumley's Red Pills on my back?\" stormed the stylishly-dressed one. \n\n\"'Gumley's Red Pills for Red-Blooded People,'\" quoted Spud, from the poster. \"Say, they are fine, Willie. Didn't you ever take 'em?\" \n\n\"No, and I don't want to. I want Tom Ro----\" \n\n\"Say, if you haven't taken any of Gumley's pills you don't know what you've missed,\" went on Spud, with a wink at the others. \"Why, there was a man over in Rottenberg who was flat on his back with half a dozen fatal diseases. The doctors gave him just three days to live,--three days, think of it! His wife nearly cried her eyes out. Then along came this Gumley man with a trunk full of his Red Pills for Red-Blooded People. He didn't exactly know if the dying man was red-blooded or not, but he took a chance and gave the fellow sixteen pills, four after breakfast, four after dinner, four after supper and four on retiring, and the next day, what do you think happened? That man got up and went to work, and he's been at his Job ever since.\" ",

He makes sure to feed them every morning and evening and always checks to see if the cats have water. Sometimes he feeds them special treats because he loves them. Each cat gets 3 treats. He doesn't give them food like chips and cake and candy, because those foods aren't good for cats. He likes to play with the cats. The cats like to chase balls of paper that Brendan makes for them. Some of his cats have orange fur, some have black fur, some are spotted and one is white. The white cat is Brendan's favorite. She is the first cat he owned. Her name is Snowball. When he first got Snowball she was a kitten. His other cats are named Fluffy, Salem, Jackie, Cola, Snickers, Pumpkin and Whiskers.",

She heard the rapid click of the type-writer, and when Martin let her in, found him on the last page of a manuscript. She had come to make certain whether or not he would be at their table for Thanksgiving dinner; but before she could broach the subject Martin plunged into the one with which he was full. \n\n\"Here, let me read you this,\" he cried, separating the carbon copies and running the pages of manuscript into shape. \"It's my latest, and different from anything I've done. It is so altogether different that I am almost afraid of it, and yet I've a sneaking idea it is good. You be judge. It's an Hawaiian story. I've called it 'Wiki-wiki.'\" \n\nHis face was bright with the creative glow, though she shivered in the cold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting. She listened closely while he read, and though he from time to time had seen only disapprobation in her face, at the close he asked:- \n\n\"Frankly, what do you think of it?\" \n\n\"I--I don't know,\" she, answered. \"Will it--do you think it will sell?\" \n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" was the confession. \"It's too strong for the magazines. But it's true, on my word it's true.\" \n\n\"But why do you persist in writing such things when you know they won't sell?\" she went on inexorably. \"The reason for your writing is to make a living, isn't it?\" ",

TREAT, JONES, WESTON & DOWD. \n\nThe particular circle of society in which Ben and Johnny moved was shaken to its very centre by the news which was whispered from one to the other on the day after those young gentlemen and Paul had taken up their abode at Mrs. Green's. \n\nEarly that morning the most exciting topic of conversation had been Master Spry's misfortune and Tim Dooley's perfidy; and that had hardly begun to be commented upon when the news spread that Ben and Johnny, since the coming of their guest, who was evidently a suspicious sort of a person, as was shown by his clothes and his entire ignorance of the slang of the street, were no longer proud of their neat little bit of real estate, but had made a change which would probably be the means of their financial ruin. That they had been so extravagant as to engage rooms at a regular boarding-house, where they were to spend their substance on three square meals each day, seemed like a reckless disregard of money; and the price which they were to pay for board was stated at various sums from five to ten dollars per week. But that was not the only bit of wonderful news. \n\nJimmy Sullivan stated--and he was supported by several others as the time wore on--that Johnny himself had told him that they were to start a regular theatre, and had already engaged a hall, which would be converted into a first-class place of amusement as soon as possible. This would have been regarded simply as a rumor started for the purpose of injuring the credit of these young gentlemen, had it not come so directly from one of the parties concerned, and must therefore be true.

Ryan got a football for his birthday and Adam got a skateboard. They like their presents, but think the basketball hoop is better. They play basketball at Jared's house with him and any other kids who show up. Alex and Brady come almost every day and Josh, Ty, and Max come sometimes. Next year, they all get to play on a basketball team. They get to play at their school. They are very excited about that and can't wait to play on a real team. For now, they are practicing a lot and are trying to get really good. They play every day they can. They are trying to be as good as the NBA players they watch on TV. They dream of someday playing in the NBA. They are sure it is going to happen.",

He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave. The other dragons were worried. When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants. They were afraid Sean might get hurt. Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed. One day he went to visit his friend Zarah and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace. \"What's that?\" he asked. \"That's a green stone,\" she told him. \"Sometimes my treasures have them. I don't really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things.\" \"If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?\" Sean asked. \"Yes you can,\" Zarah said, \"But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire.\" So Sean went to go find treasure. When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave. Soon Sean had more than enough green stones to cover his bed. Green stones never got old and brown. They don't catch fire either. So, now everyone was happy.",

There are some sandwiches here--ham and p\u00e2t\u00e9-de-foie-gras, I think. Whisky and soda or some hock?\" \n\n\"A p\u00e2t\u00e9 sandwich and some plain soda water, please,\" Sarah replied, taking off the long motoring coat which concealed her evening clothes. \"I have been fined for everything except disorderly driving--daren't risk that. Thanks!\" she went on. \"What ripping sandwiches! And quite a good play, wasn't it?\" \n\n\"I am glad you enjoyed it.\" \n\n\"It was a swindle Josephine not turning up,\" Sarah continued, as she stretched herself out in Wingate's easy-chair. \"Domestic ructions again, I suppose. How I do hate that husband of hers!\" \n\n\"It was disappointing,\" he admitted. \n\nThere was a brief pause, during which Sarah finished her sandwiches and lit a cigarette. \n\n\"Wilshaw seems to be having a little trouble with the outside porter,\" her host remarked presently. \n\n\"It must cost him at least half a sovereign every time I leave the cab,\" Sarah sighed. \n\n\"How much do you make a week out of your driving, if it isn't too personal a question?\" he enquired. \n\n\"It depends upon how much Jimmy's got.\" \n\n\"Is he your only client, then?\" \n\n\"He very seldom gives me a chance of another. Once or twice I've refused to be engaged by the day, but he sends his man around to the garage and I find him sitting in the cab when I arrive.\" ",

      "story": "Pope Benedict XVI (; ; ; born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger; ; born 16 April 1927) served as Pope from 2005 until his resignation in 2013. Benedict's election occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Since his resignation, Benedict holds the title Pope Emeritus. \n\nOrdained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958. After a long career as an academic and professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until his election as Pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Prior to becoming Pope, he was \"a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century\"; he had an influence \"second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions\" as one of John Paul II's closest confidants.",

I pity him very much.\" \n\n\"I think we all pity him,\" answered Dave. \"Nobody can be responsible after his mind breaks down.\" \n\n\"I feel sorry for Nat Poole and his folks,\" said Laura. \"This will give them a great deal of trouble, not to mention the expense.\" \n\n\"If Wilbur Poole was anywhere around Rayville it might pay to start a hunt for him,\" suggested Roger. \n\n\"I don't think you'll find him anywhere around here,\" answered Mr. Basswood. \"But it won't hurt to take a look around, if you boys care to take a walk.\" \n\nBen's father went off to send his telegram to Aaron Poole, and all the boys set off on a hunt for the wild man. They covered the streets of the village and some of the roads on the outskirts, but without success. They met three people who had talked to the strange individual, and from what had passed Dave and his chums were sure that the man must have been Wilbur Poole. \n\n\"I guess we'll have to give it up,\" said Phil, when it was getting late. \"I'm tired out. And remember, fellows, we have a hard ride before us to-morrow if we expect to reach Carpen Falls in time to hit the trail for Bear Camp before it gets dark.\" ",

      "story": "A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another. \n\nPuberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity.",

Would you fancy that?\" \n\nJeff Jones began to tremble. He knew what Paul meant--that he would be lynched inside the hour. In that section of the country, at that time, horse stealing was considered almost as bad as murder. \n\n\"No! no! doan let him take me down ter de Fork!\" howled Jeff Jones. \"Anyt'ing but dat, boys!\" \n\n\"Well, you, had better talk, then,\" returned Paul, severely. \n\n\"I doan know much, but I'll tell yo' all I do know,\" said the prisoner, after a short pause, \"and yo' is ter do de best yo' can fo' me, promise me dat?\" ",

      "story": "The Federal City of Bonn () is a city on the banks of the Rhine in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with a population of over 300,000. About south-southeast of Cologne, Bonn is in the southernmost part of the Rhine-Ruhr region, Germany's largest metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants. \n\nTogether with the capital Berlin, the city is the \"de facto\" joint seat of government of Germany. Bonn is the secondary seat of the President, the Chancellor, the Bundesrat and the primary seat of six federal government ministries and twenty federal authorities. The title of Federal City () reflects its important political status within Germany. \n\nFounded in the 1st century BC as a Roman settlement, Bonn is one of Germany's oldest cities. From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was the capital of the Electorate of Cologne, and residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of Cologne. Composer Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770. From 1949 to 1990, Bonn was the provisional capital (\"temporary seat of the Federal institutions\") of West Germany, and Germany's present constitution, the Basic Law, was declared in the city in 1949. From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government \u2013 but no longer capital \u2013 of reunited Germany.",

ON A MOUNTAIN PATH \n\n\"Armed men, my lords!\" had been Fanfulla's cry. \"We are betrayed!\" \n\nThey looked at one another with stern eyes, and with that grimness that takes the place which fear would hold in meaner souls. \n\nThen Aquila rose slowly to his feet, and with him rose the others, looking to their weapons. He softly breathed a name--\"Masuccio Torri.\" \n\n\"Aye,\" cried Lodi bitterly, \"would that we had heeded your warning! Masuccio it will be, and at his heels his fifty mercenaries.\" \n\n\"Not less, I'll swear, by the sound of them,\" said Ferrabraccio. \"And we but six, without our harness.\" \n\n\"Seven,\" the Count laconically amended, resuming his hat and loosening his sword in its scabbard. \n\n\"Not so, my lord,\" exclaimed Lodi, laying a hand upon the Count's arm. \"You must not stay with us. You are our only hope--the only hope of Babbiano. If we are indeed betrayed--though by what infernal means I know not--and they have knowledge that six traitors met here to-night to conspire against the throne of Gian Maria, at least, I'll swear, it is not known that you were to have met us. His Highness may conjecture, but he cannot know for sure, and if you but escape, all may yet he well--saving with us, who matter not. Go, my lord! Remember your promise to seek at your cousin's hand the gonfalon, and may God and His blessed Saints prosper your Excellency.\" \n\nThe old man caught the young man's hand, and bending his head until his face was hidden in his long white hair, he imprinted a kiss of fealty upon it. But Aquila was not so easily to be dismissed. ",

      "story": "CHAPTER XVII. \n\nDEFEAT. \n\nA grey dimness was creeping in upon the schooner when a little bitter breeze sprang up from westwards, and Dampier bade them get the mainsail on to her. \n\n\"I don't like the look of the weather, and I'm beginning to feel that I'd like to see that boat,\" he said. \"Anyhow, we'll get way on her.\" \n\nIt was a relief to hoist the mainsail. The work put a little warmth into them, and the white men, at least, had been conscious of a growing uneasiness about their comrades in the boat. The breeze had, however, freshened before they set it, and there were white caps on the water when the _Selache_ headed for the ice. It had somewhat changed its formation when they approached it, for big masses had become detached from it and were moving out into the open water, while the opening had become perceptibly narrower. The light was now fading rapidly, and Wyllard took the wheel when Dampier sent the man there forward. \n\n\"Get the cover off the second boat, and see everything clear for hoisting out,\" he said to him, and then called to Wyllard. \"We're close enough. You'd better heave her round.\" \n\nShe came round with a thrashing of canvas, stretched out seawards, and came back again with her deck sharply slanted and little puffs of bitter spray blowing over her weather rail, for there was no doubt that the breeze was freshening fast. Then Dampier sent a man up into the foremast shrouds, and looked at Wyllard afterwards. ",

      "story": "Multimedia is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. \n\nMultimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance. Multimedia devices are electronic media devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from mixed media in fine art; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. The term \"rich media\" is synonymous with interactive multimedia. \n\nThe term \"multimedia\" was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later 'Bobb Goldsteinn') to promote the July 1966 opening of his \"LightWorks at L'Oursin\" show at Southampton, Long Island. Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called \"intermedia\". \n\nOn August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of \"Variety\" borrowed the terminology, reporting: \"Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('Washington Square') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest \"multi-media\" music-cum-visuals to debut as discoth\u00e8que fare.\" Two years later, in 1968, the term \"multimedia\" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer\u2014one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.",

      "story": "CHAPTER XXVIII. \n\nA MEETING. \n\nAbout a week after the dissolution of the Crooked Creek Company, Harry was riding over from Hetertown, and had nearly reached the creek on his way home, when he met George Purvis. \n\nThis was their first meeting since their fight, for George had been away on a visit to some relatives in Richmond. \n\nWhen Harry saw George riding slowly toward him, he felt very much embarrassed, and very much annoyed because he was embarrassed. \n\nHow should he meet George? What should he say; or should he say anything? \n\nHe did not want to appear anxious to \"make up\" with him, nor did he want to seem as if he bore malice toward him. If he only knew how George felt about it! \n\nAs it was, he wished he had stopped somewhere on the road. He had thought of stopping at the mill--why had he not? That would just have given George time to pass. \n\nBoth boys appeared to be riding as slowly as their horses would consent to go, and yet when they met, Harry had not half made up his mind what he would say, or how he should say it, or whether it would be better or not to say anything. \n\n\"Hello, George!\" said he, quite unpremeditatedly. \n\n\"Hello!\" said George, reining in his horse \"Where are you going?\" \n\n\"Going home,\" said Harry, also stopping in the road. \n\nThus the quarrel came to an end. \n\n\"So you've sold the telegraph?\" said George. \n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"And I think we made a pretty good bargain. I didn't think we'd do so well when we started.\" ",

      "story": "A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. \n\nTwo patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. \n\nZiad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \"We were desperate,\" said Matouk. \n\nThe UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \"We are very satisfied with the results,\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. \n\nSkaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. \"Funding is a problem,\" said Hammad. \"In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants.\" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May.",

      "story": "While you are in trouble, what are you going to do? What? Cry? Or escape? Those are all the wrong way! Robinson Crusoe can tell you the right answer! It is an exciting story: Robinson Crusoe hated the comfortable life in his home town. So, he want to be a seaman and travelled around the world. But one day, a terrible thing happened. A great storm came and their boat crashed! No one was alive in this accident except Robinson. He was the luckiest man in the world--Because all his friends were dead but he was alive. However, at the same time he was the most _ man of all--He must face the fact .Alone on an island without food, water or gun!But, all roads lead to Rome!He just used his hands to work hard!Then, he made a cave, built a house, grew corn and kept goats. In the end, he could enjoy the life on the island. In his twenty-fourth year on the island, he saved a wild man, and gave him the name of \"Friday\". With Robinson's teaching, \"Friday\" became a good servant. Friday, they got a boat and escaped from the island. Surely, the writer of Robinson Crusoe is really a hero! It's too hard to describe Robinson with words. We could say that Robinson was very clever, and also he was brave,...Certainly, too many good words can describe him. But now, I think it isn't important. However, the most important thing is what we have learned from the story. That is, use our own hands to work hard with confidence!",

      "story": "CHAPTER VI.\u2014LEO ASSERTS HIS RIGHTS. \n\nAt once a crowd of performers surrounded the pair. Very few of them liked Jack Snipper, and they wondered what Leo would do should the gymnast attack the boy. \n\n\u201cCall me a braggart, will you!\u201d roared Snipper. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare to touch me with that club!\u201d replied Leo calmly. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll teach you a lesson!\u201d \n\nAnd, swinging the Indian club over his head, Jack Snipper made a savage blow at the young gymnast. \n\nHad the stick struck Leo the boy\u2019s head would have sustained a severe injury. \n\nBut as quick as a flash Leo dodged, and the Indian club merely circled through the empty air. \n\n\u201cFor shame, Snipper!\u201d \n\n\u201cDo you want to kill the boy?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat harm has he done?\u201d \n\nAnd so the cries ran on. \n\n\u201cMind your own affairs!\u201d shouted the maddened gymnast. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach the boy a lesson!\u201d \n\nAgain he sprang at Leo. \n\nBut now suddenly the Indian club was caught. A dexterous twist, and it went flying out of reach across the dressing tent. \n\nThen, before Snipper could recover, he received a stinging slap full in the face that sent him staggering backward on the grass. \n\nA shout of approval went up. \n\n\u201cGood for Leo!\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, boy, stand up for your rights!\u201d \n\nThe shout brought Adam Lambert, the general manager, to the scene. \n\nNo sooner had he appeared than all the performers walked away. It was against the rules to fight, and every one present was liable to a heavy fine. ",

Discogs currently contains over 8 million releases, by nearly 4.9 million artists, across over 1 million labels, contributed from nearly 346,000 contributor user accounts\u2014with these figures constantly growing as users continually add previously unlisted releases to the site over time. \n\nThe discogs.com domain name was registered on 30 August 2000, and Discogs itself was launched in November 2000 by programmer, DJ, and music fan Kevin Lewandowski originally as a database of electronic music. \n\nHe was inspired by the success of community-built sites such as Slashdot, eBay, and Open Directory Project, and decided to use this model for a music discography database. \n\nThe site's original goal was to build the most comprehensive database of electronic music, organized around the artists, labels, and releases available in that genre. In 2003 the Discogs system was completely rewritten, and in January 2004 it began to support other genres, starting with hip hop. Since then, it has expanded to include rock and jazz in January 2005 and funk/soul, Latin, and reggae in October of the same year. In January 2006 blues and non-music (e.g. comedy records, field recordings, interviews) were added. Classical music started being supported in June 2007, and in October 2007 the \"final genres were turned on\" \u2013 adding support for the Stage & Screen, Brass & Military, Children's, and Folk, World, & Country music genres, allowing capture of virtually every single type of audio recording that has ever been released.",

      "story": "Zen () is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty as Chan Buddhism. Zen school was strongly influenced by Taoism and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam, northeast to Korea and east to Japan, where it became known as Japanese Zen. \n\nThe term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of Dhyana (\"meditation\"). Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher. \n\nThe teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially Yogachara, the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 literature and, to a lesser extent, Madhyamaka have also been influential in the shaping of the \"paradoxical language\" of the Zen-tradition. \n\nThe word \"Zen\" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa () (pinyin: \"Ch\u00e1n\"), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word \"dhy\u0101na\" (\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 ), which can be approximately translated as \"absorption\" or \"meditative state\".",

      "story": "CHAPTER III. THE ROMAN BARONS \n\nHaving driven Charles VIII out of Italy, it still remained for the allies to remove all traces of his passage from Naples and to restore the rule of the House of Aragon. In this they had the aid of Ferdinand and Isabella, who sent an army under the command of that distinguished soldier Gonzalo de Cordoba, known in his day as the Great Captain. \n\nHe landed in Calabria in the spring of 1496, and war broke out afresh through that already sorely devastated land. The Spaniards were joined by the allied forces of Venice and the Church under the condotta of the Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, the leader of the Italians at Fornovo. \n\nLodovico had detached himself from the league, and again made terms with France for his own safety's sake. But his cousin, Giovanni Sforza, Tyrant of Pesaro--the husband of Lucrezia Borgia--continued in the pontifical army at the head of a condotta of 600 lances. Another command in the same ranks was one of 700 lances under the youthful Giuffredo Borgia, now Prince of Squillace and the husband of Do\u00f1a Sancia of Aragon, a lady of exceedingly loose morals, who had brought to Rome the habits acquired in the most licentious Court of that licentious age. \n\nThe French lost Naples even more easily than they had conquered it, and by July 7 Ferdinand II was able to reenter his capital and reascend his throne. D'Aubigny, the French general, withdrew to France, whilst Montpensier, the Viceroy, retired to Pozzuoli, where he died in the following year. ",

      "story": "(CNN) -- Before she was a princess, she was a child - shy but affectionate, respectful but mischievous. \n\nDiana Spencer, shown on her first birthday, grew up at Park House, a country estate leased from the royal family. \n\nTen years after the death of Princess Diana, two women who helped raise the future princess are providing a new, intimate portrait of the girl who would become the \"People's Princess.\" \n\nDiana Frances Spencer was born into a life of privilege. She grew up at Park House, a country home leased from the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. Her parents, Johnnie and Frances Spencer, were well-known members of the English aristocracy. \n\nInge Crane came to Park House as an au pair when Diana was just 3 years old. \n\n\"There's always been something special about Park House. It's difficult to put a finger on what it is,\" she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. \n\nLife at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. \n\nWhen the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room. \n\nDespite growing up in the shadows of royalty, Crane and Mary Clarke, Diana's nanny starting at age 9, describe an \"ordinary\" childhood for Diana, a tomboy who loved going outdoors, climbing trees and playing with animals.

Every feller who goes in wants to know where Gus is, an' he keeps out of sight all that's possible.\" \n\n\"Have you seen Mr. Wright to-day?\" \n\n\"No; but I heard he an' that lawyer of yours had a long chin about the business. Say, Bill, by the time you get out of this scrape you'll owe a pretty penny for law, I reckon. Why don't you try to make the company pay it?\" ",

Her mother lost her job. She thought she couldn't pay the $ 50 fee for the city's sports meet this year. Christian was not the only one who had this problem. Some other middle school players in the city had the same problem. That's why famous NBA player Michael Jordan gave $ 250, 000 to the city earlier this month. He wanted to help the poor students. Jordan said: \"I know there are kids who get an education by playing sports. We need to keep sports alive for them.\" Christian was _ . \"Really? I can't believe Michael did that for us. These days, I go to bed thinking about it and I wake up thinking about it,\" she said. \"Now the problem is over. \" Christian wanted to say \"thanks\" to Jordan. \"Michael, thank you for giving me the chance to show myself. I will do my best at the meet.",

      "story": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy \"The Proposal\" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ... \n\nRyan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in \"The Proposal.\" \n\nSomething old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? \n\nSandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. \n\nAnd there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is \"X-Men's\" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) \n\nMargaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) \n\nOK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. \n\nSomething new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.

      "story": "Height above average terrain (HAAT) (or less popularly, EHAAT, Effective Height Above Average Terrain) is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape. HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television, as it is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts (VHF and UHF in particular, as they are line of sight transmissions). For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this). \n\nThe FCC procedure to calculate HAAT is: from the proposed or actual antenna site, either 12 or 16 radials were drawn, and points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and radius along each radial were used. The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station. The altitude of the antenna site, minus the average altitude of all the specified points, is the HAAT. This can create some unusual cases, particularly in mountainous regions\u2014it is possible to have a negative number for HAAT (the transmitter would not be located underground, but rather in a valley, with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself, for example).",
